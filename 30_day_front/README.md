# 100 Best Books Reading Challenge
Read the Best Books of the 21st Century, according to the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/books/best-books-21st-century.html)!

## Built Using
+React.js
+JavaScript
+HTML/CSS
+Vite

## Current Progress
Thanks to [SmolJames](https://github.com/jamezmca) for the original inspiration of creating a challange and the initial tutorial to get things started! I used the tutorial as a starting point and have since then updated the website to reflect the 100 Day Book Challenge instead of the workout challenge.

## Next Steps
1. Refactor and code to completely reflect book challenge.
2. Integrate [Hardcover API](https://docs.hardcover.app/api/getting-started/) to pull data about the books.
3. Build functionality for search and selection of next book so users don't have to go in order.
