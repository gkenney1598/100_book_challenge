## Current Progress
Thanks to [SmolJames](https://github.com/jamezmca) for the original inspiration of creating a challange and the initial tutorial to get things started! I used the tutorial as a starting point and have since then updated the website to reflect the 100 Day Book Challenge instead of the workout challenge. The website now uses the [Hardcover API](https://docs.hardcover.app/api/getting-started/) to pull data about the books to populate the cards with author, book description, page count, and release year.

## Next Steps
1. Bug fix the books with inaccurate/missing data, likely due to a mismatch of name with the Hardcover API.
2. Fix some styling with overflow of book titles, data, etc
3. Build functionality for search and selection of next book so users don't have to go in order.
